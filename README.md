## 💼 About Me
👋 Hey there! I’m Vikram (Phani) —  
a developer who likes his code like his coffee:  
strong, slightly unstable, and running 60 FPS on a potato.  

🧭 Currently exploring:  
- AI-enhanced rendering (BakeLight) ☀️  
- Spectral transformers for galaxies (ASTRA) 🌌  
- Compiler experiments & low-level chaos (C→BF in Rust) ⚙️  
- AI playing games & generating chaos (ChillarCode YouTube) 🎮  
- Physics simulation world (Caveman Board) 🧱  

💡 Vision: To bridge high-performance physics, ML, and art —  
and ship it like a mad scientist who found AWS credits.

## 🚀 Projects (aka proof I don’t just sleep)  

| Project | Description | Stack |  
|---------|-------------|-------|  
| [BakeLight](https://github.com/notPhani/BakeLight) | Neural irradiance field approximator — mixes deep learning and physics to make light look smarter. | PyTorch, Mitsuba 3, NumPy |  
| [ASTRA](https://github.com/notPhani/ASTRA) | Spectral transformer predicting galaxy redshifts. Custom RoPE + MoE + multi-latent attention. | PyTorch, SciPy |  
| [C→BF (Rust)](https://github.com/notPhani/c2bf-in-RUST) | A C subset compiler that outputs Brainfuck. Insanity powered by regex and coffee. | Rust |  
| [Caveman Board](https://github.com/notPhani/Caveman-Board) | Multiplayer physics world built from scratch with adaptive spatial splits. | Go, Svelte, Supabase |  
| AI Plays Level Devil | An evolutionary algorithm trying to survive the world’s meanest platformer. | Python, OpenCV |

## 🛰️ The Story So Far  
Started out fixing bugs that weren’t mine.  
Now I break frameworks for research, and write about it like it’s poetry.  
Each repo here is a piece of my brain thrown into the cloud.  
Some code for science.  
Some code for chaos.  
All code for curiosity.

💡 **Tip:**  
Once you paste this in your `README.md`, go to GitHub → `notPhani/notPhani` → Settings → turn on **“Public Profile README”**.  
Then boom 💥 — Amazon engineers will see a boot log instead of a boring profile.
