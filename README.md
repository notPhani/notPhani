## 💼 About Me

👋 Hey! I'm **Phani** a developer based in India who rows multiple boats and somehow hasn't capsized yet.

📍 **Based in:** Vijayawada, India  
🎯 **Status:** Open for work. Aiming high. Caffeinated always.  
🚣 **Rowing boats in:** ML • Full-Stack • Systems Engineering  

💡 **Philosophy:** I like my code like my coffee — strong, slightly over-engineered, and compiled at 3 AM.  
My mission? Bridge high-performance physics, machine learning, and art. Then ship it before the caffeine wears off.

## 🚀 Projects (aka my excuses for sleep deprivation)

| Project | What It's Done To My Life | Extreme Design Choices I Took |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| [**ASTRA**](https://github.com/notPhani/ASTRA) | Taught me that galaxies are easier to understand than Python packaging. | Custom RoPE embeddings + MoE architecture for spectral transformers. Because vanilla attention wasn't suffering enough. |
| [**Optimizing-Ray-Tracing**](https://github.com/notPhani/Optimizing-Ray-Tracing) | Made me realize ML + physics = beautiful chaos. Also ruined my sleep schedule. | GAN-based path space generation + diffusion refinement with physics constraints. Yes, I mixed generative models with light transport. |
| [**AstroPixel_Spectra**](https://github.com/notPhani/AstroPixel_Spectra) | 3500 galaxy images later, I can spot a supernova but not my car keys. | Hand-curated multi-filter dataset with aligned spectra. Manual QA on astronomical data is my cardio. |
| [**c2bf-in-RUST**](https://github.com/notPhani/c2bf-in-RUST) | Proved I could write a compiler. Also proved I enjoy pain. | Hand-rolled Pratt parser + regex-based function inlining + cell-based IR. Outputting Brainfuck because why not. |
| [**Caveman Board**](https://github.com/notPhani/Caveman-Board) | My excuse to learn Go and build multiplayer physics from scratch. | Adaptive spatial hashing + Go concurrency patterns + real-time sync without a game engine. Built like a caveman. |

## 🛰️ The Story So Far

Started fixing bugs that weren't mine.  
Now I break production for science and document it like poetry.  

Each repo here is a piece of my brain thrown into the cloud.  
Some code for research.  
Some code for chaos.  
All code powered by curiosity and concerningly high caffeine levels.
